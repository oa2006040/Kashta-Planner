# Fair Split Algorithm: Expense Equalization ## Problem Definition Given **n** people in a group, each person **i** has paid an amount **Pᵢ**. We want to equalize payments so everyone effectively pays the same amount. --- ## Mathematical Foundation ### Step 1: Calculate the Fair Share (Average) $$\bar{P} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} P_i}{n} = \frac{P_1 + P_2 + ... + P_n}{n}$$ ### Step 2: Calculate Each Person's Balance For each person **i**, compute: $$B_i = P_i - \bar{P}$$ **Interpretation:** - If **Bᵢ > 0** → Person **i** is a **creditor** (overpaid, should receive money) - If **Bᵢ < 0** → Person **i** is a **debtor** (underpaid, should give money) - If **Bᵢ = 0** → Person **i** is settled (paid exactly fair share) **Key Property:** $$\sum_{i=1}^{n} B_i = 0$$ This guarantees total debts = total credits (zero-sum). --- ## The Settlement Algorithm ``` ALGORITHM: MinimizeTransactions INPUT: List of (person, amount_paid) OUTPUT: List of (debtor, creditor, transfer_amount) 1. Compute average = total_paid / n 2. For each person: balance = paid - average if balance < 0: add to DEBTORS list with |balance| if balance > 0: add to CREDITORS list with balance 3. Sort DEBTORS descending by amount owed Sort CREDITORS descending by amount owed 4. While DEBTORS and CREDITORS not empty: debtor = first in DEBTORS creditor = first in CREDITORS transfer = min(debtor.owes, creditor.owed) OUTPUT: "debtor pays creditor: transfer" debtor.owes -= transfer creditor.owed -= transfer if debtor.owes == 0: remove from DEBTORS if creditor.owed == 0: remove from CREDITORS ``` --- ## Worked Example ### Scenario: | Person | Paid | |--------|------| | Osama | 100 | | Mohammed | 20 | | Ali | 40 | | Khalid | 40 | ### Step 1: Average $$\bar{P} = \frac{100 + 20 + 40 + 40}{4} = \frac{200}{4} = 50$$ ### Step 2: Balances | Person | Paid | Balance (Paid - 50) | Status | |--------|------|---------------------|--------| | Osama | 100 | +50 | Creditor | | Mohammed | 20 | -30 | Debtor | | Ali | 40 | -10 | Debtor | | Khalid | 40 | -10 | Debtor | **Verification:** (+50) + (-30) + (-10) + (-10) = 0 ✓ ### Step 3: Settlement Transactions ``` DEBTORS:  [Mohammed: 30, Ali: 10, Khalid: 10] CREDITORS: [Osama: 50] Transaction 1: Mohammed → Osama: min(30, 50) = 30 Updated: Mohammed: 0 (settled), Osama: 20 remaining Transaction 2: Ali → Osama: min(10, 20) = 10 Updated: Ali: 0 (settled), Osama: 10 remaining Transaction 3: Khalid → Osama: min(10, 10) = 10 Updated: Khalid: 0 (settled), Osama: 0 (settled) ``` ### Final Result: | From | To | Amount | |------|-----|--------| | Mohammed | Osama | 30 | | Ali | Osama | 10 | | Khalid | Osama | 10 | **Total transferred to Osama: 50** (exactly his overpayment) ✓ --- ## Why This Works (Proof of Correctness) 1. **Conservation of Money:** $$\sum \text{debts} = \sum \text{credits} = \left| \sum_{B_i < 0} B_i \right|$$ 2. **Greedy Optimality:** Each transaction fully settles at least one person, guaranteeing at most **(n-1)** transactions. 3. **Fairness Invariant:** After all transfers, each person's effective payment equals: $$\text{Effective}_i = P_i - \text{received}_i + \text{paid}_i = \bar{P}$$ --- ## Simple Two-Person Case Your original example: - Osama: 10 QAR - Mohammed: 5 QAR $$\bar{P} = \frac{10 + 5}{2} = 7.5$$ | Person | Balance | |--------|---------| | Osama | +2.5 (creditor) | | Mohammed | -2.5 (debtor) | **Result:** Mohammed pays Osama **2.5 QAR**
